StarCraft: Brood War replay parser.

Initially this parser was developed as part of the [repMastered](https://github.com/icza/repmastered)
project (the initial history can be found there), but was outsourced here as a separate project.

Check out the sister project to parse StarCraft II replays: [s2prot](https://github.com/icza/s2prot)
